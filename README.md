# Electricity-Price-Prediction-using-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Deep-Learning

In this project multiple time series prediction models are created using different regression techniques (Linear, lasso, ridge, elastic net, Passive Aggressive, RANSAC, SGD regressor), ensamble methods (Random Forest, XG Boost) and different deep learning techniques (CNN, LSTM and CNN+LSTM)

Every Model is explained in detail in the notebook and the results as well

Single model files contains regression and ensamble models with results

Deep learning models are only present in the Prediction of Electricity_Prices.ipynb file

Test run: this file contains the best trained model (model with least MAE) being run on the test data set.
